Finish all textures:
- Useless MultiTool texture / could have a stick with all tool heads from the sides as the recipe shows. (See the recipe) -> (SH) switch texture on use? -> (J) pretty crazy idea, could work but a bit weird
- Super useless block texture / like normal block, but with flashing brightness change
